# Rowan Thorpe's Blog

[My twitter stream]({% avatar rowanthorpe %} https://twitter.com/rowanthorpe)

This will be my new blog (hosted under github-pages), but its just a holding page for now until I migrate my
[old blog](https://rowanthorpe.wordpress.com) to here. The code for this blog is
[here](https://github.com/rowanthorpe/rowanthorpe.github.io) - my github account is @rowanthorpe. You can
find my email address at my github profile if you need to contact me.

Having said the above, and having not yet set this up as a proper "blog" (no commenting system, etc), here
is the first proper "blog post" anyway:

* My solution for having the
  [latest Firefox in Debian without Pulseaudio installed]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-12-17-firefox-without-pulseaudio-in-debian %}).

and this is just another test-post for my benefit:

* [Link to a test post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-03-17-test-post %}).
